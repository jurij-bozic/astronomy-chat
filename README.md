# Astronomy Chat App
This is a chat application built with ReactJS, and with the aid of the [GetStream](https://getstream.io/) React libraries and db-service. All the packages and commands needed to run the app are supplied in the package.json/package-lock.json files.

## Running the app
The app has a front-end (client) and backend (server). To run the client, navigate to its folder and run `npm start`. To run the server, navigate to its folder and run `npm run dev`.

## Main functionalities
The app provides a basic **chat functionality** and also an **asteroid tracker**, build on top of NASA's API-service.


### NOTES
- This app is **not yet fully complete**. It presently lacks full support for mobile devices, though it currently does have basic functionality for these.
- The basic logic for this app was inspired by the [Medical pager chat](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/project_medical_pager_chat).
